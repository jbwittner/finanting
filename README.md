## Pull requests

When you create a pull request, a series of actions will launch.
To merge the pull request, all actions must be succeeded.

One of the action is a static check of the code. We used PMD (https://pmd.github.io/), ESlint and Prettier.

To check the code :
- frontend : run the command `npm run lint` and `prettier:check`
- server : run the command `mvn pmd:pmd` and check if the file pmd.html on the folder `target/site` exist.

**All remarks must be taken into account**

Finally, a manual validation of the pull request is necessary.
